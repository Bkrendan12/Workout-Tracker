## Tech Used

html, css, javascript, node.js, express, mongodb, mongoose

## Motivation

I wanted a way to track my workouts whether it be resistance or cardio. With this app, I am able to add workouts, mark a workout as complete, and track them on a graph chart. Sleak and simple.

## GIVEN a Workout-tracker application

```
WHEN I run the application
THEN I am presented with the homepage of the workout tracker app with some basic options.

WHEN I click on "Continue Workout"
THEN I am able to enter in the workout I do regulary and add that data to the database

WHEN I finish entering in the data
THEN I can select whether I have completed the excerise OR to add it to the database to hold data.

WHEN I click on "New Workout"
THEN I can follow the previous steps and select "Add Excersise"

FROM the homepage
WHEN I select "Dashboard"
THEN I am brought to a new page which shows a graph chart displaying my workout duration in minutes as well as the amount of pounds from resistance workouts
```
